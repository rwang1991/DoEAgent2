## Handling Large DOE Datasets

### Overview of Large Data Challenges

When working with large DOE datasets (>1000 rows or >100KB), several challenges arise:

1. **Base64 Encoding Overhead**: Increases file size by ~33%
2. **Token Limits**: Large base64 strings consume many AI Foundry tokens
3. **Processing Time**: Analysis time increases significantly with dataset size
4. **Memory Constraints**: Azure Functions have memory limits

### Recommended Solutions

#### 1. Cloud Storage URLs (Recommended) üåü

Instead of base64 encoding, upload your data to cloud storage and use direct URLs:

**Azure Blob Storage:**
```
"data": "https://yourstorage.blob.core.windows.net/data/doe_data.csv?sas_token"
```

**SharePoint (with direct download link):**
```
"data": "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/site/Shared%20Documents/doe_data.csv?download=1"
```

**GitHub Raw Files:**
```
"data": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/data/doe_data.csv"
```

#### 2. Intelligent Sampling üéØ

For datasets >1000 rows, the function automatically applies intelligent sampling:

```json
{
  "data": "your_data_url_or_base64",
  "response_vars": ["Yield", "Purity"],
  "predictors": ["Temperature", "Time", "Pressure"],
  "max_rows": 1000,
  "force_full_dataset": false
}
```

**Sampling Features:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves experimental design structure
- ‚úÖ Maintains factor level proportions
- ‚úÖ Uses stratified sampling for response variables
- ‚úÖ Provides sampling transparency in results

#### 3. File Format Optimizations

**Compressed CSV (reduces size by 60-80%):**
```
"data": "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/data/doe_data.csv.gz"
```

**Parquet Format (most efficient):**
```
"data": "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/data/doe_data.parquet"
```

### Size Guidelines and Recommendations

| Dataset Size | Recommendation | Method | Expected Performance |
|--------------|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| < 500 rows | Base64 encoding OK | Direct analysis | < 10 seconds |
| 500-1000 rows | Cloud URL preferred | Direct analysis | 10-30 seconds |
| 1000-5000 rows | Cloud URL + sampling | Intelligent sampling | 15-45 seconds |
| > 5000 rows | Cloud URL + sampling | Intelligent sampling | 30-60 seconds |
| > 10,000 rows | Contact support | Custom solution | Variable |

### Enhanced AI Foundry Prompts for Large Data

#### Prompt 1: Large Dataset with URL
```
I have a large DOE dataset (3000+ rows) stored in Azure Blob Storage. Please analyze this data and provide insights about the most significant factors:

URL: https://yourstorage.blob.core.windows.net/container/large_doe_data.csv

Response variables: Yield, Purity, Strength
Factors: Temperature, Time, Pressure, Catalyst_Type, pH

Since this is a large dataset, please use intelligent sampling for faster analysis and let me know:
1. Which factors are most significant across all responses
2. Any important interactions to consider
3. Recommended process settings for optimization
4. Whether the sample provides reliable insights
```

#### Prompt 2: Force Full Dataset Analysis
```
I have a moderately large DOE dataset that I need to analyze in full (no sampling). This is critical analysis for regulatory submission:

[Upload your data or provide URL]

Response variables: Critical_Quality_Attribute, Impurity_Level
Factors: API_Concentration, Excipient_Ratio, Processing_Temperature

Please analyze the complete dataset (force_full_dataset=true) and provide:
1. Comprehensive factor screening results
2. Model validation statistics
3. Design space recommendations
4. Risk assessment for each factor
```

#### Prompt 3: Large Dataset Troubleshooting
```
I'm having issues with my large manufacturing dataset. The process seems unstable and I need to identify root causes:

Data location: [SharePoint/GitHub/Blob URL]
Dataset size: ~2500 experimental runs
Problem: High variation in key quality attributes

Please use intelligent sampling to quickly identify:
1. Primary sources of variation
2. Factors causing instability
3. Interaction effects that might explain the issues
4. Recommended follow-up experiments

Note: Use sampling for rapid insights, then we can do detailed analysis on specific regions.
```

### Sample Response Interpretation

When analyzing large datasets, the AI will provide additional context:

```json
{
  "models": { ... },
  "summary": { ... },
  "data_info": {
    "analysis_rows": 1000,
    "was_sampled": true,
    "sampling_info": {
      "original_rows": 3000,
      "sampled_rows": 1000,
      "sampling_method": "intelligent_sampling",
      "note": "Representative sample preserving experimental design structure"
    },
    "size_validation": {
      "status": "ok",
      "memory_mb": 45.2
    }
  }
}
```

**AI Interpretation:**
"üìä **Large Dataset Analysis Summary:**

Your dataset contained 3000 experimental runs. To ensure optimal performance and reliable results, I used intelligent sampling to analyze a representative subset of 1000 runs that preserves your experimental design structure.

üéØ **Sampling Quality:** The sample maintains the same factor level proportions and response variable distributions as your full dataset, ensuring the insights are representative of your complete experimental space.

üìà **Key Findings:** [Analysis results...]

üí° **Recommendation:** The sample provides reliable insights for factor screening and optimization. For final model validation, consider analyzing the full dataset with force_full_dataset=true."
